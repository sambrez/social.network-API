## Credits
I utilized the MongoDB documentation throughout this project. Specifically, I referenced documentation on getter functions and the proper syntax to include them in the schema for models. I also referenced the freeCodeCamp.org article (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-date-now-how-to-get-the-current-date-in-javascript/) which covers the Javascript Date object and functions that allow you to reformat the date.
